# Homework13_A

Given an integer array A, we want to divide the array in to k non-empty sub-arrays.

The sum of each sub-arrays can construct another array BB with k integers.

We can construct many different B depends on the different ways we divide array A.

We want the largest number in B is minimized.

Output the minimized largest number in B_{ans}

B_{ans} which contains the smallest largest number among all the other B.

A sub-array is a contiguous part of the array.
